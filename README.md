A simple tool aiding creation of book indexes.

## What it's all about
This app is a simple web interface to my **index_parser.py** script, which I made for my girlfriend when she had to create indexes for medical books. The most important part of the script is the sorting feature, which saves a lot of time compared to sorting these index entries by hand. 

This script is intended to work well with unsorted index files that already roughly resemble the end result presented [here](https://index-helper.herokuapp.com/rules)
